# Floppy Bird
 A simple engine for a Flappy Bird clone.

## What's this?
This is a Flappy Bird clone I made to practise my JavaScript skills (I'm a beginner, don't @ me). All I wanted to learn from this was collision, a score system, ... That's also the reason why it's just an engine without sounds, textures or anything to make it look good. Doing that takes too much time (and I already know how to do it), so it's not worth it and I'm better of trying my hand at another project.

## What has to be added?
I'm not going to finish this project, but if someone wants to they definitely can. It would need the following:
1. Bird rotation depending on Y velocity
2. Bird and pipe sprites
3. Background sprite
4. Sprites for the text / score
5. Menu screen
6. Sound effects
7. Probably a lot more!
